<p class="">BSides Vancouver Island (BSidesVI) is an annual conference for security practitioners and those interested in (or looking to enter) the field.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="">Our event is a source of education, communication, and collaboration. The technical and academic presentations at BSidesVI are given in the spirit of peer review and for the dissemination of knowledge among all specialties.</p>
<p>BSides Conferences are a little different than the usual security conference format. BSides are not-for-profit, independently run, community-supported, low-cost security conferences that happen all over the world. </p>
